Why we have to use netwoking?
When we run the two continer like c1->front-end c2-backend
server was runs on seperate network ip and docker continer will runs on sperate ip
to build communication between both containers and host server that is called bridge networl
Bridge network is default network it will created automatically when you run the containers
there was a problem like c1 and c2 will runs same network ip if c1 is hacker there is chance to hack c2
Host network:containers will with the host nerwork ip only so we not prffer these.
overlay network:it will use on kubenetes
Finally, we have chance like custom bridge network
custome bridge network:useing these we can create custom bridge network and we can mouth to specific container
docker network ls
docker network create shasi-secure
docker run -d login imagename
docker run -d logout imagename
both login and logout contianers was running on bridge network
docker run -d --network shsi-secure payments images
paymets was running in custum bridge net work
how can i check may custime brigh network was secure or not
inspect login and logout conatiner
docker inspect logout
they will provide one ip adresss
open login container
docker exec -t /bin/bash/
apt-get installs iputils-ping
ping <log out ip address>it will run communicating eachother
now try with payments image ip
if it works not was not secure,if it is dont work it is secure
