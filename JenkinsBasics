Jenkins
------------
=====================================================================================================
jenkins repo
jenkins keys
java11
git
maven
jenkins

====================================================================================================
it is help to perform automatic testing like continues initigration and continues deployement
_>continoues integration is nothing but we developers written a code in sub part we can comabin all the code here
   _.code-.build->integrationn->continue inegration
   ->code deployement->code-.build->integration->UAT(user acceptance test)-> Continudeployement
   
Why CI?
before CI 
3 developer code will store in git hub repositry then->move to integration-> testing
After CI 
We created one server that is only CI server
3devlopers code will store in git hub then it will rul all the funtions at atime like build test deployement
-----------------------------------------------------
What is pipeline
it is nithing but step by step excution
verion cotrol(github code will stored hree)
build(take that code and build it to conver jar file or war file)
unit test(testi g will done here is thre any error it will go back and again build the code till success)
deploy
auto testdeploy to production
after it will give production feedback
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Workflow
--------
we can attach git,mavin,selenium,Aritifactry plugins to jenkins.thats why we have to install git maven java
once developer put the code github jenkines will pull the code and send to maven to build
once build the code and jenkins will pul that code and sent to selinum for testing
once testing is done.jenkins pull the cosde and send to arctifactory
we can also deploy with jenkins

jenkins master is divide the work to slaves
to give commuication between master and slaves we have to install some keys
According to lables the work will be assign
like l1->slave1 l2->slave 2

------------------------------------------------------------------
it is open sources and build in java
developed by sun microsystems.(saled to oracle)
jenkins based on plugin tooles,there are1000+ plugins in jenkins
it also support the cloud based architure.
ow to install jenkins using with yum ?
Create a instance _. connect->
First we have to check jenkins is there in our package or not
how we can check

 


go to the yum.repo.d directory
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
to check our linux details the command is
->cat /etc/os-release

after checking that
before installing jenkins we have to install java
when in server we didt have amazon-linux -extras
we can use these command
sudo dnf install -y java-11-amazon-corretto-devel
after that install jenkins'
and enter that passwords and install all plugins

Basic -> project->go to new item->free projeect->excute 

Now we have to install jenkins?
first we have to install java
to install java it is avilable in amazon-linux-extras
but extras packeage only avilabale in Amazon linux 2 only..not avilable in Amazon linux  2023
To install java _>sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y
next step is 
Now we have to enable the epel-relase
sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel
after thet we hve to move the file to yum.repos.d/
sudo curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key
now we have to install jenkins
sudo yum install jenkins -y
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now coming to 2023 Amazon linux proxcess isc
 create ec2 instance and connect-
 google -> jenkins->download with redhat links->
first we have to download a repositry  

->sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repos

after that we have to create a key
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key

after that we have to install java with these link 
sudo dnf install -y java-11-amazon-corretto-devel

to check that java installed or not
java -version
after we have to install git in server jenkins
after we also install maven
Now we have to instal jenkins
sudo yum install jenkins 
to check that
 sudo systemctl status jenkins
 to enable the service
 sudo systemctl enable jenkins
 
now it is ready to use
goo to google
and paste ip address and along ith port number 8080
they give some password address
copy that path and past in cmd
password will come.

======================================================================================================================================================
Now how to connect jenkins masteer to slaves
using labels master will assign to slaves
why we have to use?
 to avoid a work load 
how to create that lables.
first we have install jenkins and tooles after that connect to dashboard
we have t change bin/false to bin/bash
sudo vim /etc/passwd
_. edit and save thatb file.
now we have to check user 
sudo cat /etc/passwd
there will show the jenkins user
 now we have to give passwd for that user
 sudo passwd jenkins
 it will ask create a password 
->now we have to all permmisions have root user  to jenkins 
sudo visudo
edit that
add content root permmisions
jenkins ALL(ALL) NOPASSWD : ALL

->now we have to config in sshd(all incoming requested is recived by the ssh and send to sshd )
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
edit that password authetication YES
Now all the data is encrypted
note:for every modifictation in ssh_config we have to restart the server compulsary
----------------
Now we have to login to slave?
first we have to create seperate instance and comnect
these istance is slave instance
we have add user jenkins
sudo useradd jenkins(we have to create manullly)
create password
sudo passwd jenkins
password created
after that proces
sudo visudo
give permmisions to created user
jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
edir pass word authentication in
sudo etc/ssh/ssh_config
When we chose that slave concept meanse
i code writeen ina
1 java and 2 .net
on that time we have to go that.
another point is
if arctitucutre is big meance then go to slaves
to decrease the prize.
example
if project is getting to 16gb ram it get more cost
then we have to go and create a slave for 8gb
in master we manages uat and devel
in slave proud
all information will be on master jenkins
first we have to check what coad we have to excute
java appliction ->MAVEN
.net ->.net code
anugalr-.node
python->python
those onfo will give from develops
to remove authentivationa
sudo vi /var/lib/jenkins/config.xm
l
 
====================================================================
Now go back to master and connect

login to jenkins
 sudo su - jenkins
 ------------------------------------------
ALL THE JENKINS SET UP IS DONE TILL HERE
----------------
Deloper will push that code to source code management(git hug,git)
after that we have to test
afyet we havr to build
usinf ci tool we have to deployement
first we have to integrate sourse code management (GIT)

How to integrate git hub?
open that jenkins dashboard
->create new item-
->select free project
->git
->enter git link
->in credetioan we have to give our credential.
_.branch specifer->git hub coade branceh.
_.save and build now
now checkout pur
now all the files will be cloned in jenins
check in my workspace
------------------------------------------------------
Freestyle job
    ->template job
Maven job->only java application
Pipeline job
71b33558fd57432caf2352cb1eab80c1
-------------------------------------------
jenkins is not only for take a code (SCM)
it also set the order to run the code
general->we cant acesse when n disble
  ->discard old builds
    ->log rotations_.multi ples bills are going on 
	  it will deside how many days the bill be in veiw
	  ex;we have to give cleaned we have to set that time
	->paarametaized->singel job we have to use multiple environement UAT,Dev etc
  ->Build steps: what have to do going in same
    ->excute shell->mkdir class shasi
	it will well create a folder whwn we donw build now
	_>to check that we can go to work space it will be visible
 ->build trigger
   _>poll SCm-> is used to i  which time the next trigger will perform
   ->it will be seduled with the help on CORNTAB site
 ->post build actiona->after the build of project what should they do is mention in the post biuild action
===============================================================================================
all the builded jobs will be stored i these path o nly
And the Jenkins Home directory is /var/lib/jenkis
=============================================================================================
NOW WE HAVE TO RUN ON JAVA CODE
----------------------------------
to run java code we have to follow some rule like maven lifecycles

MAVEN LIFE CYCLE
----------------
Validate
Compile
test
package
integration test
verify
install
deploy
---------------------------------
Now we have to install apachenmaven repo and key
sudo wget https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/dchen/apache-maven/epel-apache-maven.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-apache-maven.repo
sudo sed -i s/\$releasever/6/g /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-apache-maven.repo
sudo yum install -y apache-maven
mvn --version
https://github.com/jilu407/test-maven.git(java 11)

we have to give build steps
Excute shell-
 mvn --version
 mvn install
 mvn test
 mvn compile
 mvn package
if you find any null in console the problem is java version is the problem.
then chnage the version and build again
sudo /usr/sbin/alternatives --config java
enter a number which version: +3
build it will be run

===========================================================================
we have to install maven plug in jenkins
jenkins dasboard->manage jenkins-> plugin->Avilable-> maven integrationa
check new item it will show maven project
By using these also we can deploy
new item
select maven project
git ur
set maven path
save 
and build

till now we deployed java project using
free style job
maven plugin job
=====================================================================================================
Now what is the pipeline job
 in  free style all will done in manually
 but in pipeline it eill be run using script
 declarative pipeline
 scripted pipeline
 syntsx:
 pipeline{
 ageny any
 stages{
 stage('stage1'){
 commands
 }
 ]
 
 }
 Scripted pipeline
 node{
 stage('stage'){
 command
 }
 
 
 
 
 
 diff to run script we have to go script pipe line
 ============================================================
 pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
        stage('first') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello first'
            }
        }
        stage('secound') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello second'
            }
        }
    }
}
===================================================================
now we have to do some operations
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('scm') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/jilu407/test-maven.git'(we can build these code using help of piplesyntax)
            }
        }
        stage('install') {
            steps {
                sh "mvn install"
            }
        }
        stage('test') {
            steps {
                sh "mvn test"
            }
        }
        stage('compile') {
            steps {
                sh "mvn compile"
            }
        }
        stage('package') {
            steps {
                sh "mvn package"
            }
        }
    }
}
these is the basic script and tis is the form of creating pipeline
it is nothing like process will do step by step.
=============================================================================================
Now we can see the scripted pipe line
node {
    
    stage('SCM') { 
        git 'https://github.com/jilu407/test-maven.git'
    }
    stage('install') {
        sh "mvn install"
        
    }
    stage('test') {
        sh "mvn test"
        
    }
    stage('compile') {
        sh "mvn compile"
        
    }
    stage('package') {
        sh "mvn package"
        
    }
}
==================================================================================================
Another way to excute pipeline script

first we have to write pipeline script save in git hub
now goto pipeline select pipeline scm
and give the repositry link and enter thst file name and buildit
it will work
till here we have completed compiling 
===============================================================================================
Deploy without CD/CI
deploy with tomactserver
now we first we install tomcat
select AMI-linux-2
aws->create instance->connect
sudo yum update
yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk11
(phaseing any problem sudo amazon-linux-extras enable java-openjdk11)

goto google
download apache tomcat 10
goto browse
and select linus file->goto bin->
exampe:https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-10/v10.1.31/bin/apache-tomcat-10.1.31-fulldocs.tar.gz
ls
you an see tar file 
to extract that tar file 
->tar -xvf(x-xtrat v-verbose f-file) apache-tomcat-10.1.31-fulldocs.tar.gz
->tomcat folder will be shown
now move that tomact file /opt/ folder
because all third party file will store in that folder only
->sudo mv tomcat-10.1-doc /opt/
now i want to start my tomcat server
got tomact folder open bin-
in bin folder
->sh startup.sh
-.now tomcat was started
now copy ip addres add 8080 port number
it will open default tomcat server 
now all the operations will done Manage APP
but we have to do some configration
enter command
vi /opt/tomcat/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml

<!--  <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
 allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" /> -->
 
seletct above paragraph and comment it.

Now we have to create Tomcate users.
sudo vi /opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml

we have to write script for that
<role rolename="manager-gui"/>(to create roles)
<role rolename="manager-script"/>
<role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
<role rolename="manager-status"/>
now we have to create user and assig those roles.
<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui,manager-script,manager-jmx,manager-status"/>
<user username="deployer" password="deployer" roles="manager-script"/>
<user username="tomcat" password="s3cret" roles="manager-gui"/>

now save that
and agai  start the tomcat
sh startup.sh
it will ask login details.

now we have to deploy than
 gotp perviues jenkins profile ec2
 jenkins dashboard ->manage jenkins->plugin->avilable plugins->deploy to container
 istall it
 open job
 confige
 select post build acctions
 and selevte Deploy war.ear files container
 enter **/*.war (to check war file)
 select container
 tomcat 9.x
 give tomcat url
 and generate credentials.
 save and build now.
 the peoject will shown i  tomcat page
 
 if we can edit the code in git must we can do commit
 
 after commit the file then we can click again build now
 other wise we can also shedule that.
 cofige job->build triggr-.poll scm-.*****
 
 ======================================================================================================
d43fadfec0234a2997f0b772f12171f4

system configration
system
-------
excuters max jobs to run
node
====
it ise nthing when we running multiple jobs at a time
we have to  create node and redirect that files.
create thoise file in tomcat
sudo mkdir /opt/jenkins-node/
also we have to install git we installsatl plugins in jenkins node 
give these path in root direcory.
select web socket
save
when you create a project 
then select 
Restrict where this project can be run

=======================================================================================================================================
Now we have to do one project
u8zeywthhuylkoi7sds54


10gb file will convert to 10mb done by maven
10mb file convert into container is done by docker.
