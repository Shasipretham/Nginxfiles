DOCKER
==================
When we using flipkart we are doing many things like
payment page
order page
delivary page
therse pages couple off applications
we can called as micro services
why we have to create these micro serviecs?
if any problem in payment page meance it will effect only payment page
other order,delivary pages will get running only 
thats why we crearted amicro services.

How to install docker
create insance->connect it
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y docker
sudo su
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
docker ps
mkdir dockerDemo
git clone https://github.com/DEVOPS-WITH-WEB-DEV/spring-cloud-kubernetes.git

mvn clean install -DskipTests(used to installl dependecies for that project)
diff between mvn clean and mvn compile
   mvn clean it will clean only target folder
   mvn compile it will chenk code is in proper structure or not.
 after it will come build successes
 ls -lrta(l-long lasting format,-r to reverse the order of out put,-t modification team,-a it show the hidden file.
 it is used to see target folder is there or not.
 
open that folder and now we can obserer the jar file is there or not
till here we created a 10gfile to 10mb file usimg with maven
 now we have to create docker image



100mb file(covert to 10mb file through maven)
now 10mb (5mb image convert to 5mb through container)
