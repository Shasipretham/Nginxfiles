helm is a package manager for kubernetes.
->Example:
we are using yun for linux and apt for Ubuntu
In the same way helm for kubernetes.
we have to install controls like ingresss,grfana,promethious,alert manager,ingress controlleer
step-1: we have to create repository
step-2: we can install packege like helm install ingress.
instead of these why we have to use helm
if we have to install prometious or grfana we have to create sperate names space ,seperate service account all we have to do seperately
But when we use helm it will create automatically those things.

how to install helm in server?
Browser->install helm->it will display official site open that and go to installtion.
sudo dnf install helm
if we have 3 eks clusters for which cluster that helm was connected?
helm was connected to the current cluster.
How to see that current cluster?
->kubectl config current-context
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
to check that
->helm search repo bitnami
bitnami is couple of services 
->if we want to install nginx using bitnami
->helm search repo bitnami | grep nginx
What is the diff between Charts and Repo?
Charts is bundel of an application.
All charts will store in repo
when we download a prometous to install that we have to so namespace and policy all are in stored in Charts
For example:we are using bitnami repo in that we have lot of charts like prometous,grafana and nginx.
how to install those charts using bitnami?
helm install nginxv1 bitnami/nginx(nginxv1 is nothing like name thats it)
Now check nginx was installed or not
kubectl get pods 
it will show pods.
Now i want install prometous
first we have to check that promethoues was there or not in bitnami
helm search repo bitnami | grep promethues
if that package was not avilable in bitnami what we have to do?
we have to install alb it was not in bitnami repository
browser->install alb with helm->open aws documentaion and file commad and run.
helm repo add eks https://aws.github.io/eks-charts
helm repo update eks
Now check load balancer was there that eks repo or not
helm search repo eks | grep -i load
i want to see installed packegs using helm
helm list
To unistall package
helm unistall nginxv1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if we want to crete our own repo
like we are working on e-comm website
one cluster for payments->create chart
one cluster for shipping->create chart
pust to charts into that repo.
create two dirctory
mkdir -p bestecomm/{payment,shiping}
cd bestecpmm
and create
helm create payments
helm create shipping
Now you open that payments folder
cd payments
ls ltr
now you can see that chart.yml,values and templtes like files.
in chart.yml it will have all metadata like owner name.
in templets it will store deployment.yml files. we have to store all deployments.yml files.
in values.yaml is used to customize the files inside the templets.
do modifications in those files and bundel it like create a chart
helm package shipping
helm package payment
it will create one zip file.
helm repo index .
helm add repo
to see the values in another repo'
helm show values eks/nginx
