Why Bind mounts and volumes?
when we run a conatiner it will not store the log files in backgroud
if container will down all the logs files also deleted
and another problem container was not read a files in host server 
to solve that problem Bind mounts
Blind mounts do if container will delete also i will blind the folder it will store on host server
after when re reun the container it will automatically mounts to that container.
