Why Bind mounts and volumes?
when we run a conatiner it will not store the log files in backgroud
if container will down all the logs files also deleted
and another problem container was not read a files in host server 
to solve that problem Bind mounts
Blind mounts do if container will delete also i will blind the folder it will store on host server
after when re reun the container it will automatically mounts to that container.
volumes also same like blinds mounts but it have life cycles
for volumes we can creeate volumes of every were like another ec2,s3 ...
volumes are to share one container to another container
to check docker volumes
docker volumes ls
docker volume create shasi
now u can use volume one or two continers 
you want details about volume 
docker volue inspect sasi
docker volume rm shasi
to mount volume
docker run -d --mount source:shasi,target=/app imagename
now we can inspect the container
docker inspect continaer name
now you can check in mount section
