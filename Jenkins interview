1.Can you explain the process of cicd  in your current process?
in my current project we are using jenkins tool for CI CD
Code commit:when the developers commited a code there
jenkins trigger: jenkins pipeline trigger automatically
build: to build the code we have to use maven tools
quality check: using sonarqube we can check our quality.
create conatiner:after that we have to create container using docker.
check container: to check container quality we can use trivy for that
run container:after that we can run container.
2. What are differnt ways to trigger jenkins?
These can be done in many ways
build triggers:we have configure in jenkins for every minute on every 10min it will go and run those commands if there is change in code 
it will automatically run.
poll scm: it will run pipeline when you fix specific time..if you set anty 1:45am every day at 1.45am it will run pipeline.
webhooks: we have to create webhook in git and add jenkins ip there when developer is commited code it automatically trigger the code.
3.How to backup jenkins?
