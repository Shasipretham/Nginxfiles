1.What is Docker?
it is open source Containerizion platform and 
it enables developers to package application into containers.
2.How containers was differ from Virtual machins?
Containers have light weigth because there dont have complete os (it have minimal files and folers)
for vm we have OS it was take high storage(it will store all the files and folders)
3.Docker life cycle?
First we have to write a docker file with set commands after completing Docker file
we have to build that docker file it was turn to Docker image to create a container we have run that commmnd,
to create docker image ->docker build -t <filename> .
to run image ->docker run -d -p 8080:8080 <image name >
4.What are different componets in docker?
When we use docker we have to install the docker we can call as docker demon
when we run commands like docker build or docker then Docker Demon will understand ok we have to build file or run
when you use docker pull Docker will understands there asking image we have to search in our registry.
5.What is the diff b/w docker ADD and Docker Copy?
Doocker add is used for copy the files from url.
Docker copy it will copy the files from our host system
6.What is the diff between CMD and ENtrypoint?
When you use CMD like
CMD ["echo","shasi"]->if write these cmd command and build
if you want output ->docker run shasiimage
output: shasi
if you run command like ->docker run shasiimage "DOCKER"
output: DOCKER->it will over ride the content.
Now i want to print both like shasi Docker togeather
we have to use ENTRYPOINT
ENTRYPOINT ["echo","SHAS"]
now run->docker run shasiimage "DOCKER"
output :SHASI DOCKER
if you dont enter parametor along with command we want default value then we have use both CMD and Entrypoint
CMD ["Pretham"]
ENTRYPOINT ["echo" "Shasi]
now run it ->docker run shasiimage 
output shasi pretham
CMD sets default command and parameters, which can be overwritten when running the container.
ENTRYPOINT sets the main command that always runs, making the container behave like an executable.
Combination: ENTRYPOINT defines the executable, CMD provides default arguments that can be overridden.
7.What are the networking types in docker and what is default?
Default network is Bridge network 
also we can change the networks like Bridge,Overlay,Host,Macvlan
Bridge->first it will access the host after eithernetwork it will access application inside the container
host->user can acess the application using the host network
overlay->it is used for multiple host at time
8.Can you explain how to isolating networking between the containers?
if you deployed on application running in default docker zero network in web
if we havw payments application we have run with another networking type like my_bridge in payments
if web was hacked your payments will safe.
9.What are the  muiltstage building in docker?
To decrease the container size we have use muiltystage
Builder stage: Installs dependencies only
Final stage: Uses smaller alpine base image
Production-only: npm ci --only=production avoids dev dependencies
Smaller image: Final image only contains runtime dependencies
Better caching: Dependency installation is separate from code changes
Finally there will be two stages in muilti stage builder stage all the depenceces will done secont stage we can take alpain it
small os it will take less storage.
in final images only contains a runtime dependency.
10:what are the distro less images in docker?
it will store only your application and it runtime dependencies with very minimal operating systems
it will not conatin any package manageers.they are very light weight images.
